Good evening professor,

my name is Henry Maldonado, this is my 4th year at New Paltz as a Computer Science major, with a very strong background in Mathematics. I've taken almost every course New Paltz has offered (CS1,2,3, Software Engineering, Operating Systems..) aside from this course, Projects, and Cyber Security. I've coded a couple Skill calculators for the game Runescape, and am proficient in HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript. I've collaborated with a group on a video game for my Software engineering class, and my job was to code a simple inventory system. Although its my fourth year here I still feel like theres a lot about Web Development and Programming I may not know yet, and I'm excited for learning everything you have to teach me and for the projects I am going be completing.


I see myself learning a lot in this course, and taking what I learn and applying it to some hobbies I find interesting. I love music and gaming, so I was thinking of making Web apps that have to do with this. Like a guitar tuner or interactive music application that explains different musical concepts for the younger generation who are interested in music. Or something like an interactive piano that plays corresponding notes when a key is clicked. I also love math so some math applications for certain concepts I would find really interesting as well.

The past couple years have definitely been hard. As a commuter I spent 2 semesters completely taking classes from home, but for me I felt like I've always done better actually going to school and attending lectures. I took a lot of important Computer Science courses for this major all online, and a part of me feels like I probably would have learned/retained all the information from those courses alot better if they were actually in person. I still learned a lot, but the past 2 semesters feel like a blur at times. I'm just happy to be in person for my last semester here at New Paltz for my degree, and it will be a pleasure to learn and apply as much as I can from you on any future projects I decide to work on.
